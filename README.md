Mixed Messages Codecademy Project

## Project Objective
You’ll build a message generator program that outputs a new, random message every time a user runs the program.

### Detail
Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. You’re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. 

### Objectives Detail
- [ ] Build a message generator program using JavaScript
- [ ] Use Git version control
- [ ] Use command line
- [ ] Develop locally on your computer

### Other Info
Your program should showcase basic JavaScript syntax and programming concepts.
